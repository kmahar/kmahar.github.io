Hi, I'm Kaitlin. My pronouns are she/her. I live in Brooklyn, NY.<br><br>

I'm a senior software engineer at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). I work on the Core Server team, which is responsible for developing and maintaining the database itself. You can read more about my work history [here](/work).<br><br>

In my free time I enjoy doing crosswords, cooking, crocheting, birdwatching, and playing with my cats.<br><br>

I'm **not interested** in pursuing new roles at this time.

Please note I am NOT the same Kaitlin Mahar who writes about products for Wirecutter, Parade, etc. - please do not contact me about anything related to that. <br><br><br>[twitter](https://twitter.com/k__mahar) | [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlinmahar/) | [email](mailto:kaitlinmahar@gmail.com)<br><br>
