Hi, I'm Kaitlin.

My pronouns are she/her.

I'm a senior software engineer at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), where I lead development of the [official MongoDB driver for Swift](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver).

Previously, I did my S.B. and M. Eng. in computer science at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/).

Outside of my work, I like doing crossword puzzles, playing with my cats, and trying all of the amazing food and drinks NYC has to offer.

I'm **not interested** in pursuing new roles at this time, but please feel free to get in touch about anything else.
