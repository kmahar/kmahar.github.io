Hi, I'm Kaitlin. I'm a software engineer living in NYC.

I work at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), where I lead development of the [official MongoDB driver for Swift](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver).

Previously, I did my S.B. and M. Eng. in computer science at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/).

Outside of my work, I like doing crossword puzzles, playing with my cats, and trying all of the amazing food and drinks NYC has to offer.
