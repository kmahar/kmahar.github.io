Hi, I'm Kaitlin. My pronouns are she/her.

I'm a lead engineer at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). I manage the teams developing our official drivers for [Swift](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver) and [Rust](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver).
I'm the primary author and maintainer of the Swift driver, and a member of the [Swift Server Work Group](https://swift.org/server/).

Previously, I was an individual contributor at MongoDB, and before that I did my S.B. and M. Eng. in computer science at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/).

Outside of my work, I like doing crossword puzzles, playing with my cats, cooking and baking, and trying all of the amazing food and drinks NYC has to offer.

I'm **not interested** in pursuing new roles at this time, but please feel free to get in touch about anything else.
