Hi, I'm Kaitlin. My pronouns are she/her. I live in Brooklyn, NY.

I'm a senior software engineer at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). I work on the Core Server team, which is responsible for developing and maintaining the database itself. You can read more about my work history [here](/work).

In my free time I enjoy doing crosswords, cooking, crocheting, birdwatching, and playing with my cats.

I'm **not interested** in pursuing new roles at this time, but please feel free to get in touch about anything else.
