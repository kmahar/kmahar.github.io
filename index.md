Hi! I'm Kaitlin. I'm a software engineer living in New York City, working at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Before this, I did my S.B. and M. Eng. in computer science at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/). Outside of tech, I like crossword puzzles, current events and politics, and animals. Click around to learn more about my projects, read my blog posts, or get in touch.
