## **@ MongoDB**

### Core Server Team
*Senior Engineer, February 2023-present*<br><br>

I recently made an internal transfer onto the Core Server team! More updates to come after I've been there for a while ðŸ™‚

### Database Experience (DBX) Team
*Lead Engineer (Engineering Manager), August 2020-February 2023*<br>
*Senior Software Engineer, February-August 2020*<br>
*Software Engineer, August 2017-February 2020*<br><br>

I spent 5 years on the DBX team at MongoDB, first as an individual contributor and then as an engineering manager.<br><br>

DBX builds the open source libraries that enable developers working in numerous popular programming languages to use MongoDB in their applications.<br><br>

As a lead, I managed various combinations of the teams developing our official libraries for [Swift](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver), [Rust](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver), and [Node.js](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native). My day-to-day included a mix of people management, providing technical direction and leadership for the languages I managed as well as department-wide initiatives, writing and reviewing [specifications](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications) defining cross-language driver behavior, and contributing code to the Rust and Swift libraries.<br><br>

As an individual contributor, my primary accomplishment was the authorship of the Swift driver, which I brought from a single-file, 100-line proof of concept to a full-fledged, production-ready, idiomatic driver for building server-side Swift applications using MongoDB.<br><br>

Throughout my time on the team, I worked extensively to establish a relationship between MongoDB and the Swift community by
[speaking](/speaking) at conferences and on podcasts, submitting a proposal (which was accepted) for the Swift driver to take part in the [Swift Server Work Group](https://swift.org/sswg/) incubation process, and eventually joining the work group myself, which I served as a member of for almost 3 years.<br><br>

## **@ MIT**
*Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 2016-2017*<br>
*Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2012-2016*<br><br>

My master's research focused on interviewing people who had experienced online harassment, and using their insights and input to build [Squadbox](https://squadbox.org), a tool to help people experiencing online harassment by allowing them to coordinate a "squad" of friends to moderate their incoming messages.<br>
You can learn more about the tool, try it out, and learn how to contribute to the project by checking out the [website](https://squadbox.org) and [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox).<br>
The project got some press coverage from [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/mit-researchers-squadbox-lets-friends-combat-online-harassment-2018-4), [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/recruit-your-friends-to-stop-online-harassment-1825041913), etc.<br><br>

My collaborators and I published both a [paper](/files/squadbox-paper.pdf) and an [extended abstract](/files/squadbox-demo.pdf) about Squadbox at [CHI 2018](https://www.chi2018.acm.org).<br><br>

My thesis is available on [MIT DSpace](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/119593).
