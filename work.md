## **@ MongoDB**
I'm a member of the Drivers team. We build the open source libraries that enable users of all programming languages to use MongoDB in their applications, along with a number of other driver-like tools for working with MongoDB. 

I'm the technical lead for [`MongoSwift`](https://www.github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver), the official MongoDB Swift driver. The driver provides an idiomatic MongoDB API for Swift applications running on iOS, tvOS, watchOS, MacOS, and Linux, and works with both traditional and embedded MongoDB (i.e. MongoDB Mobile). I wrote the driver from scratch, and continue to maintain it and add new features.

I also have recently worked on [`mongomirror`](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/import/mongomirror/), a utility written in Golang that enables users to seamlessly migrate data between MongoDB replica sets. This tool makes it possible for MongoDB users to import their replica sets into Atlas, our database-as-a-service, without shutting down their database or applications.

I serve as a mentor to junior engineers and interns, and [speak](/speaking) about Swift and MongoDB at technical conferences.

## **@ MIT**
My master's research focused on interviewing people who had experienced online harassment, and using their insights and input to build [Squadbox](https://squadbox.org), a tool to help people experiencing online harassment by allowing them to coordinate a "squad" of friends to moderate their incoming messages. 
You can learn more about the tool, try it out, and learn how to contribute to the project by checking out the [website](https://squadbox.org) and [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox). 
The project got some press coverage from [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/mit-researchers-squadbox-lets-friends-combat-online-harassment-2018-4), [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/recruit-your-friends-to-stop-online-harassment-1825041913), etc. 

My collaborators and I published both a [paper](/files/squadbox-paper.pdf) and an [extended abstract](/files/squadbox-demo.pdf) about Squadbox at [CHI 2018](https://www.chi2018.acm.org).
