## **@ MongoDB**
*2017-present*

I'm a member of the Drivers team. We build the open source libraries that enable users of all programming languages to use MongoDB in their applications.

I'm the lead developer of [`MongoSwift`](https://www.github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver), the official MongoDB Swift driver. The driver provides an idiomatic MongoDB API for server-side Swift applications running on MacOS and Linux. I wrote the driver from scratch, and I continue to maintain it and add new features along with a couple other members of the Drivers team.

In the past I've contributed to the MongoDB C and Node.js drivers, and worked on a number of utilities written in Golang, including [mongomirror](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/import/mongomirror/), [Atlas Data Lake](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/data-lake), and the [MongoDB Agent](https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/tutorial/nav/mongodb-agent/).

I serve as a mentor to junior engineers and interns on my team, and [speak](/speaking) about Swift, MongoDB, and related subjects at technical conferences.

My master's research focused on interviewing people who had experienced online harassment, and using their insights and input to build [Squadbox](https://squadbox.org), a tool to help people experiencing online harassment by allowing them to coordinate a "squad" of friends to moderate their incoming messages.
You can learn more about the tool, try it out, and learn how to contribute to the project by checking out the [website](https://squadbox.org) and [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox).
The project got some press coverage from [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/mit-researchers-squadbox-lets-friends-combat-online-harassment-2018-4), [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/recruit-your-friends-to-stop-online-harassment-1825041913), etc.

My collaborators and I published both a [paper](/files/squadbox-paper.pdf) and an [extended abstract](/files/squadbox-demo.pdf) about Squadbox at [CHI 2018](https://www.chi2018.acm.org).

My thesis is available on [MIT DSpace](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/119593).
