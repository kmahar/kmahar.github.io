## **@ MongoDB**
*Lead Engineer, August 2020-present*<br>
*Senior Software Engineer, February-August 2020*<br>
*Software Engineer, August 2017-February 2020*

I'm a lead engineer on the Drivers team. We build the open source libraries that enable developers working in numerous popular programming languages to use MongoDB in their applications.

As a lead, I manage the teams developing our official drivers for [Swift](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver), [Rust](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver), and [Node.js](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native).

I'm the primary author and maintainer of the Swift driver, which provides an idiomatic API for using MongoDB in server-side Swift applications running on MacOS and Linux.

I [speak](/speaking) about Swift, MongoDB, and related subjects at technical conferences.

I'm also a member of the [Swift Server Work Group](https://swift.org/server/), a steering team that promotes the use of Swift for developing and deploying server applications. The SSWG provides technical direction for Swift libraries and tools with the aim of creating a healthy and robust server-side ecosystem.

My master's research focused on interviewing people who had experienced online harassment, and using their insights and input to build [Squadbox](https://squadbox.org), a tool to help people experiencing online harassment by allowing them to coordinate a "squad" of friends to moderate their incoming messages.
You can learn more about the tool, try it out, and learn how to contribute to the project by checking out the [website](https://squadbox.org) and [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox).
The project got some press coverage from [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/mit-researchers-squadbox-lets-friends-combat-online-harassment-2018-4), [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/recruit-your-friends-to-stop-online-harassment-1825041913), etc.

My collaborators and I published both a [paper](/files/squadbox-paper.pdf) and an [extended abstract](/files/squadbox-demo.pdf) about Squadbox at [CHI 2018](https://www.chi2018.acm.org).

My thesis is available on [MIT DSpace](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/119593).
