# **@ MongoDB**
My main focus so far has been building [`MongoSwift`](https://www.github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver), our official driver for Swift. The driver provides an idiomatic API for Swift applications to communicate with the database.

I also work on [`mongomirror`](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/import/mongomirror/), a utility written in Go that enables users to seamlessly migrate data between MongoDB replica sets.

I've also contributed to the [Node.js](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/) and [C drivers](http://mongoc.org/), and I've done rotations on the teams responsible for the [Automation Agent](https://docs.cloudmanager.mongodb.com/tutorial/nav/automation-agent/), the [BI Connector](https://www.mongodb.com/products/bi-connector), and [Sharding](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/).


# **@ MIT**
My master's work focused on interviewing people who had experienced online harassment, and using their insights and input to build [Squadbox](https://squadbox.org), a tool to help people experiencing online harassment by allowing them to coordinate a "squad" of friends to moderate their incoming messages. 
You can learn more about the tool, try it out, and learn how to contribute to the project by checking out the [website](https://squadbox.org) and [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox). 
The project got some press coverage from [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/mit-researchers-squadbox-lets-friends-combat-online-harassment-2018-4), [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/recruit-your-friends-to-stop-online-harassment-1825041913), etc. 

My collaborators and I published both a [paper](/files/squadbox-paper.pdf) and an [extended abstract](/files/squadbox-demo.pdf) about Squadbox at [CHI 2018](https://www.chi2018.acm.org).
