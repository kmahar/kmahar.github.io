# **Squadbox**

My master's work focused on interviewing people who had experienced online harassment, and using their insights and input to build [Squadbox](https://squadbox.org), a tool to help people experiencing online harassment by allowing them to coordinate a "squad" of friends to moderate their incoming messages. 

My work on the project has continued since leaving MIT, as we work to convert it from a research tool to a robust, secure, and usable system. You can learn more about the tool, try it out, and learn how to contribute to the project by checking out the [website](https://squadbox.org) and [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/amyxzhang/squadbox). 

We've also recently had some press coverage from [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/mit-researchers-squadbox-lets-friends-combat-online-harassment-2018-4), [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/recruit-your-friends-to-stop-online-harassment-1825041913), etc. 

#### Related Publications
My collaborators and I published both a [paper](/files/squadbox-paper.pdf) and an [extended abstract](/files/squadbox-demo.pdf) about Squadbox at [CHI 2018](https://www.chi2018.acm.org).
